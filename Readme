To install all dependencies and packages used - frontend and backend
    1.npm i 

**Important Note**
The backend is already connected to my own MongoDb for easy use 
but like said its not being protected in a .env folder and not a best practice .
In-order to connect it with your own backend and protect it please do create a .env folder and store the connection credentials .
**-------------------**

To run the backend server - use the following commands in terminal
    1.node index.js

To run frontend server - 
    1.npm start


To deploy it -
    1.use "npm run build" inside front-end folder
